# Size Justifications:
## Standard Box is 37" x 11":
- If normally in an 11" box we can fit 4 Canvas Gallery. That means each Canvas Gallery occupies 2.75"
- If normally in an 11" box we can fit 6 Paper Print Framed. That means each Paper Print Gallery occupies 1.83"

# Large Box:
A Large Box is 44" x 13".
To Fit 1 Canvas Gallery (2.75") and 6 PPF (1.83") It takes a total of 11.91" which is less than 13". So we can fit them all into a single Large Box.
